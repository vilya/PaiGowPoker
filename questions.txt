- When choosing the best hand, do we ONLY consider the percentage of wins out
  of the total or should we consider draws and losses too?

- What's the evaluation criteria? Is it total execution time or the generation
  time (i.e. not including I/O)? The two sentences in that section are
  contradictory.

  -> If I/O time is included, memory mapping is probably going to be the
     fastest solution...

- How do they get the figures for the number of dealer hands, in the example?
  In hand #1, the dealer has 10 cards implying the number of possible hands is

    (10 choose 5) * (5 choose 2)
    = 10! / (5! * 5!)  *  5! / (3! * 2!)
    = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)  *  (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)
    = (30240 / 120) * (20 / 2)
    = 252 * 10
    = 2520

  But in the example the dealer only seems to have 120 hands...?

  Actually, I've just noticed that my figures for number of dealer hands are
  exactly 21 times theirs in both cases. Which makes me suspect either they or
  I are consistently making the same error.
