- Instead of comparing hands directly, compute a score for each hand and
  compare scores.

- Skip any hand that has a lower score than the current one?

- Given a deck of 52 cards, the dealer has at most 45 cards to choose from.
  (45 choose 5) * (40 choose 2) == 952972020, which will fit in 30 bits.

- There ought to be a more direct way to calculate the number of
  wins/draws/lossed than iterating through them all.

- If ranking is only based on wins, just calculate the number of wins?

- Score calculation needs to be as fast as possible.
