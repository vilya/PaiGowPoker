General
-------

- Instead of comparing hands directly, compute a score for each hand and
  compare scores.

- Calculate scores for all player hands and store them, since there'll only be
  21 of them. Compare each dealer hand to all 21 at once, so that we never have
  to store or recalculate a dealer hand.

- Given a deck of 52 cards, the dealer has at most 45 cards to choose from.
  (45 choose 5) * (40 choose 2) == 952972020, which will fit in 30 bits, so use
  unsigned ints for the results.

- There ought to be a more direct way to calculate the number of
  wins/draws/losses than iterating through them all.

- Score calculation needs to be as fast as possible.
  - Represent each hand as a bitset per suit
  - If any suit contains 5 bits, we've got a flush.
  - If we OR all the suits together, then:
    - 5 consecutive bits means we've got a straight.
    - The total number of set bits is the number of groups.
    - The bit positions indicate the card value of each group.
  - Can check for pairs by AND-ing all combos of 2 suits together:
    (clubs & diamonds) | (clubs & hearts) | (clubs & spades) |
    (diamonds & hearts) | (diamonds & spades) |
    (hearts & spades)
  - Can check for three of a kind by AND-ing all combos of 3 suits together.
  - Can check for four of a kind by AND-ing all suits together.

- Need to be able to calculate the nth combination directly, as well as
  iteratively.


Of dubious benefit
------------------

- Skip any hand that has a lower score than the current one?
  - Need to be able to predict fairly accurately which hands will be best/2nd
    best/worst, which is hard to do.

- If ranking is only based on wins, just calculate the number of wins?
  - Not sure whether this would save us anything. We still need to calculate
    the results for each possible hand to figure out how many wins there are.


Parallelisation
---------------

- Use TBBs parallel_reduce.

- Each block has it's own win/loss/draw count per player hand.

- The () operator over a range of combinations for the dealer hand, playing
  each combination against all 21 player hands.

- The join step adds these counts together.
