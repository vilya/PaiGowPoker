- When choosing the best hand, do we ONLY consider the percentage of wins out
  of the total or should we consider draws and losses too?

- What's the evaluation criteria? Is it total execution time or the generation
  time (i.e. not including I/O)? The two sentences in that section are
  contradictory.

  -> If I/O time is included, memory mapping is probably going to be the
     fastest solution...
